# Amazon Clone 1.0 (E-commerce Web App)

This is my first react project and it was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### `npm install firebase`

Installs firebase.


### `firebase login`

Login to your Firebase account.


### `firebase init`

Initializes firebase.


### `firebase emulators:start`

Runs backend server.


### `firebase deploy --only hosting`

Deploys the frontend.

You run this in the project's `root` directory.


### `firebase deploy --only functions`

Deploys the backend (but you need to be on Blaze plan for this to work).

You run this in the `functions` directory.
