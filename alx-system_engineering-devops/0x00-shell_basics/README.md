# 0x00 Shell Basics

The objectives of doing the tasks under this topic were to know how to navigate through a file system, manipulate files, learn about some shortcuts used in bash, understand bash scripting, e.t.c. Most of the tasks require me to create a file, write a shell command in it, and make it executable. Below are the bash scripts in this directory and their function.

## Mandatory Tasks
