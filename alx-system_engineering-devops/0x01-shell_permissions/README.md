# 0x01 Shell Permissions

The objectives of doing the tasks under this topic were to know what do the commands ```chmod```, ```sudo```, ```su```, ```chown```, ```chgrp``` do, learn about linux file permissions, how to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit, how to change permissions, owner and group of a file, how to run a command with root privileges, and how to change user ID or become superuser. Most of the tasks require me to create a file, write a shell command in it, and make it executable. Below are the bash scripts in this directory and their function.
